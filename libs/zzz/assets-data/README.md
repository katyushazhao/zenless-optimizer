# zzz-assets-data

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test zzz-assets-data` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Note

The `dm` library does not exist yet, so most things are placeholders.

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement the `dm` library.
- [ ] Replace placeholders with actual data.
- [ ] Complete the asset data generation logic.
- [ ] Add unit tests for the asset data generation.
