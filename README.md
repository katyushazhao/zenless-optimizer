[Zenless Optimizer](#) is a helper website for the online action-rpg gacha game [Zenless Zone Zero](https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/). It is intended to assist players with optimizing artifacts to max-min their characters, while providing a clean, structured UI, and provide real-time results.

## Zenless Optimizer Roadmap

### Main site

- New characters and content will continue to be added as Zenless updates
- Migrate Genshin Optimizer features to Zenless Optimizer

## Code structure

ZO is hosted as a monorepo.
The Applications are in [/apps](/apps/)
The dependencies to the apps are in [/libs](/libs/)

### Applications

[`zi-frontend`](/apps/zi-frontend/) - WIP ZO frontend - website built using NextJS, MUI, supabase, using the Pando calculation engine.
